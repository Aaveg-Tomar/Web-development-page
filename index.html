            Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it's the work that happens behind the scenes to
            make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience. Web developers, or
            'devs', do this by using a variety of coding languages.
            Web development ranges from creating plain text pages to complex web-based applications, social network
            applications and electronic business applications.

        <p style="margin-top: 1px;">
            The web development hierarchy is as follows:
        <p style="margin: 0px;">1.Client-side coding.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0px;">2.Server-side coding.</p>
        <p style="margin: 0px;
            margin-right: -15px;">3.Database technology.</p>

            <h2><b>Comparing Front-End and Back-End Development</b></h2>
            <p class="p10"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and
                        interactivity</strong> using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They take an idea from the drawing board
                    and turn it into reality. </span></p>
            <p class="p10"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of
                    the website,
                    the drop down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series
                    of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These
                    programmes are run through a browser.</span></p>
            <p class="p10"><strong>The backend developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes.</strong> This is
                where the
                data is stored, and without this data, there would be no frontend. The backend of the web consists of
                the server that hosts the website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data.</p>

            <h2><b>What about Full-Stack Development?</b></h2>
            <p class="p10">If both Frontend and Backend development appeal to you, you could consider becoming a <a
                    href="#">Full-Stack Developer</a>.</p>
            <p class="p10">Full-stackers take care of both the front-end and the back-end, and need to know how the web
                works on all
                levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate. Naturally working up to this
                level of expertise will take longer, as there is more to learn.</p>

                        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections,
                        paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. However, it's worth noting that HTML
                        is not considered a programming language as it can't create dynamic functionality.
